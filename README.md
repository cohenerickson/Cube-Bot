## Overview

Cube Bot is a Rubik's cube robot built using an Arduino. It uses 5 stepper motors to control 5 of the 6 sides of the cube. Even though there isn't a way to directly rotate the final side of the cube, there are sequences of moves that can rotate all the pieces around the center without actually turning that side. In fact, a robot consisting of just 4 motors is still possible.
